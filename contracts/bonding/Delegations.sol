/**
 * @title Delegations
 * @author Nico Vergauwen (@kyriediculous)
 * @notice Delegations is a Solidity library that handles accounting logic for a stake based protocol whereby users
    can stake tokens and earn rewards in that tokens as well as fees in another token or ETH.
    
    The implementation details and actual handling of funds transfer is left to the implementer
        of the library so the library is token standard agnostic.
    
    The library uses share-based accounting whereby a nominal amount of shares represent 
        an intrinsic amount of stake (including rewards) and protocol fees. Meaning that
        while the amount of shares a user holds can remain unchanged, the amount of stake
        and fees it represent can fluctuate as rewards/fees are earned or the delegate's 
        stake is slashed.
